# FlyHamlet

The FlyWire fruit-fly connectome (v783, 139,255 neurons, 15.1 M connections, 54.5 M synapses)
run as a leaky integrate-and-fire network, dropped into a 2D arena that doubles as a
typewriter, and used for two experiments: how much entropy does the typing have, and can the
brain serve as an entropy source that eventually types Hamlet?

> **Where the randomness comes from.** The wiring is deterministic and the network is silent
> at rest: with no input and no noise, no neuron ever spikes and two runs are identical. Every
> bit of randomness in the keystroke logs and in the entropy-source experiment comes from the
> **injected Poisson background drive and the stochastic arena (looming) inputs**, seeded from
> `config.yaml`, not from the connectome itself. The brain shapes and mixes that noise; it does
> not create it.

## Live browser sessions and replay viewer

GitHub Pages opens a fresh browser simulation of the **full** FlyWire v783 network,
with all 139,255 neurons and 15,091,983 connected pairs. The initial visit downloads
48.5 MB of compressed wiring data; a Web Worker computes new spikes, sensorimotor
activity, movement, and keystrokes without a server. **New session** resets neural
state and chooses a new cryptographically generated 32-bit seed. Pause/resume,
target speed, and the trajectory trail work during live sessions. The display shows
simulated time and the actual simulation-to-wall-time ratio; full-network computation
may run slower than real time. Background tabs pause the session.

The browser model (`site/live-model.js`) ports the Python LIF equations, float32
arithmetic, update order, signed synapses, delays, refractory behavior, arena controller,
and key-region rules. It skips resting neurons and exact floating-point fixed points
without removing neurons or connections. Its xoshiro128** random stream reproduces
browser sessions by seed but differs from NumPy PCG64, so identical seed numbers do
not reproduce the historical Python trajectories. The hovering artwork is a visual
interpretation of the model’s walking trajectory.

Four saved 300-second runs remain available in the **Session** menu. These load
`site/data/flyNN.json` and retain playback speed and scrubbing. Live sessions never
load those trajectory files. Both modes share the keyboard, manuscript, neural
readouts, and rolling chart. Reduced-motion preferences disable autoplay and
cosmetic movement. Space toggles pause/resume when focus is outside a control.

The **[Learning lab](https://quadrin.github.io/FlyHamlet/learn.html)** runs a separate,
live two-letter benchmark with a supervised decoder and explicit key presses.
Its protocol and limits are described in [Experiment 3](#experiment-3-two-letter-learning).

Locally, run `python -m http.server` in the repository root and open `/index.html`.
The viewer templates are `site/head.html` and `site/body.html`; styling and orchestration
are `site/style.css` and `site/replay.js`. Run `python scripts/build_site.py` after
editing the templates. UI-only rebuilds reuse committed data and require no pandas.

To regenerate the full browser wiring export from the public release tables:

```bash
python scripts/export_browser_connectome.py
node --test tests/test_live_model.cjs
```

`site/model/manifest.json` records the exact configuration, target neuron indices,
key layout, source URLs and SHA-256 hashes. The worker checks the decompressed
array hashes before starting a session. Python simulation remains available through
`flyhamlet/run_flies.py`, with `--live` for its matplotlib viewer.

## Setup

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/download_data.py      # ~280 MB from the public flywire-data bucket, then builds data/cache
python -m pytest -q                  # 34 tests, ~15 s, no data download needed
```

## Phase 0: data

The public v783 release tables are served by Codex from
`https://storage.googleapis.com/flywire-data/codex/data/fafb/783/` (the download page on
codex.flywire.ai needs a Google login; the bucket does not). Files used: `neurons.csv.gz`
(neurotransmitter predictions), `connections_no_threshold.csv.gz` (every synapse, no per-pair
threshold: this is exactly the 15,091,983-pair table Shiu et al. used for v783),
`classification_with_fw_and_hemibrain_types.csv.gz`, `consolidated_cell_types.csv.gz`,
`labels.csv.gz`, `names.csv.gz`.

`python -m flyhamlet.data` prints:

```
neurons: 139,255   connected pairs: 15,091,983   synapses: 54,492,922
nt: ACH=90,692 GLUT=24,854 GABA=19,176 SER=2,113 UNK=1,250 DA=935 OCT=235
sign: +1 = 95,225   -1 = 44,030
super_class: optic=77,536 central=32,388 sensory=16,903 visual_projection=8,053 ascending=2,362 descending=1,303 ...
```

Neurons without a prediction in `neurons.csv` (18,408) take the synapse-weighted majority
neurotransmitter of their output connections. Sign: ACh, DA, OCT, SER excitatory; GABA and
glutamate inhibitory (Shiu et al.). `Connectome.neurons_of_type`, `search_types` and
`search_labels` look names up in the annotation tables; nothing is addressed from memory.

## Phase 1: simulator

Shiu et al. 2024 (Nature, *A Drosophila computational brain model reveals sensorimotor
processing*) parameters, taken from their public Brian2 model (`philshiu/Drosophila_brain_model`):

| parameter | value |
|---|---|
| resting / reset / threshold | -52 / -52 / -45 mV |
| membrane / synaptic time constant | 20 / 5 ms |
| refractory period, synaptic delay | 2.2 ms, 1.8 ms |
| weight per synapse | 0.275 mV, connection weight = sign(pre) x synapse count x 0.275 mV |
| timestep | 0.1 ms (Brian2 default clock) |
| activation | Poisson events adding 68.75 mV to v (forces one spike per event), no refractory period on activated neurons |

The two linear ODEs are integrated exactly per step. Update order follows Brian2's schedule
(state update, threshold, synapses + Poisson, reset), and, as in Brian2, synaptic input that
arrives while the postsynaptic neuron is refractory is discarded. The implementation was
verified spike-for-spike against Brian2 2.9 on deterministic chains (`tests/test_sim.py`,
`tests/data/brian2_chain_*.json`); getting the refractory-input rule right moved the full-network
comparison from r = 0.95 to r = 0.99 (see below).

**Backends.** A custom sparse implementation: state updates are fused numba loops
(parallel over neurons) and spike delivery walks the CSR rows of the spiking neurons only;
the same algorithm exists in numpy and in PyTorch (for a GPU). All three produce bit-identical
spike trains on CPU. No GPU was available here, so the torch path is only timed on CPU.
`results/benchmark/benchmark.md` (4 CPU cores, 20 sugar GRNs driven at 150 Hz, 1 s simulated):

| backend | x real time |
|---|---|
| numba | ~3-4x |
| numpy | ~11x |
| torch (CPU) | ~40x |
| Brian2 (authors' model, cython) | ~70x |

**Determinism.** With no input and no background noise the network is at rest and no spike
ever occurs. All stochastic inputs draw from one `numpy.random.Generator(seed)`; same seed,
same inputs, same backend => identical spikes.

**APIs** (`flyhamlet/sim.py`): `inject_current(target, mV)`, `inject_poisson(target, rate_hz,
weight_mV, to='v'|'g')`, `set_background(rate_hz, weight_mV, target)`, `silence(target)`,
`subscribe(target, callback)` (per-timestep spike delivery), `step()`, `run()`. Targets are cell
type names, root-id lists, label regexes, super classes or index arrays.

**Validation** (`python -m flyhamlet.validate`, `results/validation/report.md`): the 20
labellar sugar GRNs of Shiu et al. that exist in v783 are driven at 10-200 Hz; the contralateral
MN9 fires from 25 Hz drive upward, MN6 and MN8 join at higher drive, the responder count is in
the low hundreds, and per-neuron rates match the authors' own Brian2 model run on the same
v783 tables with Pearson r = 0.987-0.998:

| GRN rate (Hz) | MN9 contra ours | MN9 contra Brian2 | responders ours / Brian2 | r |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 50 | 10.2 | 14.5 | 289 / 276 | 0.987 |
| 100 | 62.8 | 62.0 | 374 / 366 | 0.994 |
| 150 | 79.2 | 88.5 | 393 / 385 | 0.996 |
| 200 | 90.2 | 90.0 | 430 / 415 | 0.998 |

## Phase 2: arena and typewriter

See `docs/phase2_dn_screen.md` for the annotation check and the looming screen that chose the
readout. Turning = `turn_gain` x (left - right) rate of DNa02 + DNa01 (both respond to
contralateral looming, so the fly turns away from walls); speed = `base_speed` + `speed_gain` x
DNp09 - `backward_gain` x MDN (moonwalker DNs drive backward walking). Walls within
`wall_distance_mm` drive that eye's LC4 + LPLC2 with proximity-scaled Poisson input. The arena
(90 x 30 mm) is a 3 x 9 grid of keys, letters assigned by a seeded permutation; a keystroke is
logged only when the fly enters a new key region (`sim_time_s,key_index,letter,x,y,heading_deg`).

```bash
python -m flyhamlet.run_flies --n-flies 4 --duration 300 --procs 4   # headless, seeds 42..45
python -m flyhamlet.run_flies --n-flies 1 --live                      # matplotlib live view
```

## Experiment 1: typing entropy

```bash
scripts/run_experiment1.sh          # or: python analysis/entropy.py --out results/entropy_exp1
```

Results (`results/entropy_exp1/report.md`; 4 flies x 300 s, seeds 42-45, 1,139 keystrokes,
0.95 keystrokes/s, no wall contact):

| bits per keystroke | fly typist | uniform grid walk (null) | uniform 27-key typist (null) |
|---|---|---|---|
| H0 marginal (Miller-Madow) | 4.70 | 4.73 | 4.75 |
| H(X_t+1 \| X_t) | 1.65 | 1.67 | 4.75 |
| LZ76 rate, length-matched | 1.89 | 2.45 | 4.16 |

All 27 keys are visited, the transition graph is one strongly connected component and has no
absorbing key. The marginal is nearly uniform but the conditional entropy is that of a random
walk on the grid: because a keystroke is only logged when the fly *enters* a region, consecutive
keys must be neighbours, and the LZ76 rate (1.89 bits) is below the grid walk's (2.45) because the
fly walks in long straight lines and reverses, which is more predictable than a random walk.

Hamlet (167,325 characters after cleaning) uses 468 distinct letter pairs; under this key layout
only 105 of them are grid-adjacent, so P(Hamlet) = 0 for *any* fly on this typewriter, not just
this one. The fitted model has 414 zero-probability pairs (150,475 of Hamlet's 167,324
transitions), listed with their Hamlet frequencies in the report. With Laplace smoothing the
expected number of keystrokes is ~10^313493, versus 27^len = 10^239503 for the uniform typist.

## Experiment 2: fly brain as entropy source

```bash
scripts/run_experiment2.sh          # tapped flies -> whiten -> typist -> NIST tests + dieharder files
```

The tap samples 500 central-brain neurons (seeded; the list is dumped next to the ISI file)
that are neither of the wired sensory/motor types nor their direct synaptic partners, and
streams `(neuron, ISI in timesteps)` records to a binary file. `analysis/whiten.py` hashes
batches of 64 ISIs with SHA-256 and turns bytes into keys by rejection sampling (bytes >= 243
rejected, then mod 27); raw ISIs are never used mod 27. `analysis/typist.py` streams the keys
through a suffix automaton of Hamlet and reports the longest Hamlet substring ever produced.
`analysis/entropy_tests.py` gives the NIST SP 800-90B most-common-value and collision
min-entropy estimates on the raw ISIs and writes raw and whitened 32-bit streams for
`dieharder -g 201 -f <file>`.

Results (`results/entropy_exp2/report.md`; 4 flies x 120 s, background 200 Hz x 4 mV, 500 tapped
neurons per fly of which ~430 fire, median 2.6 Hz): 3,603,323 raw ISIs -> 56,301 SHA-256 batches
-> 1,709,435 keys (accept fraction 0.949).

| data | NIST 800-90B estimator | min-entropy |
|---|---|---|
| raw ISI symbols (26,477 distinct values) | most common value | 7.55 bits / sample |
| raw ISI bits (21-bit words) | MCV / collision | 0.34 / 0.20 bits / bit |
| raw ISI low byte | MCV | 7.15 bits / byte |
| whitened SHA-256 bytes | MCV | 7.91 bits / byte |
| whitened SHA-256 bits | collision | 0.94 bits / bit |

The raw ISIs carry real entropy (about 7.5 bits per interval by the MCV bound) but are far from
uniform as words: the high bits are almost always zero, which is exactly why they are hashed
rather than used mod 27. Typist: after 1.7 M keys the longest substring of Hamlet produced is
8 characters (`'c look y'`, found at key 26,236) at 2.3 M keys/s through the suffix automaton;
a 9-character record is expected after ~3e7 keys and Hamlet itself after ~27^167325 = 10^239503.

dieharder (`results/entropy_exp2/dieharder.txt`, subset sts_monobit / sts_runs / sts_serial /
diehard_runs / operm5 / rank32x32, `-g 201` raw 32-bit words): the raw ISI stream fails 34 of 36
results outright (2 weak); the whitened stream gives 11 FAILED / 11 WEAK / 14 PASSED. That
whitened profile is not a defect of the source: a same-sized (1.8 MB) `/dev/urandom` control file
run through the identical subset gives 9 FAILED / 13 WEAK / 12 PASSED, because dieharder needs
gigabytes and rewinds a small file many times per test (all 56,301 SHA-256 digests in the
whitened stream are distinct, byte mean 127.54). A full-battery dieharder run needs a much longer
tap (`entropy_tap.duration_s`) and `scripts/run_dieharder.sh`.

## Experiment 3: two-letter learning

Open **[Learning lab](https://quadrin.github.io/FlyHamlet/learn.html)** and select
**Run experiment**. This is a fresh computation using the full connectome, not a
recording. The default target speed is 1×; a complete run simulates 24 seconds,
with wall time depending on the device. Pause/resume preserves the experiment.
Backgrounding the page pauses computation. A new experiment clears the decoder
and chooses a fresh seed; an entered seed reproduces the same protocol.

The question is deliberately small: can an **external supervised decoder** learn
to distinguish two artificial sensory inputs after they propagate through a
fixed fly brain model? This tests cue classification/copying. It does not test
recall of a phrase, understanding of language, or learning inside the connectome.

| Phase | Trials | Decoder updates | Scoring |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| Baseline | 20 | Off; zero initial weights | Every decision |
| Training | 60 | One supervised logistic update after each decision | Before its update |
| Evaluation | 40 | Frozen at the end of training | Fresh sensory-noise trials |

Each phase is balanced between T and O and independently shuffled. T drives the
annotated left LC4 + LPLC2 population, O the right, with 100 Hz Poisson input for
200 ms. Each trial resets neural dynamic state to rest with an independently
derived noise seed. The neural RNG, target schedule, and decision tie-breaking
use separate seeded streams. Decoder weights persist across trials.

The decoder receives seven downstream, per-neuron mean rates over the final
150 ms: left/right turning, forward and backward groups, plus giant fiber. Every
feature is `min(rate_hz / 100, 1)`. Stimulated sensory neurons are excluded; the
classifier receives no target, trial index, phase, seed, or prior outcome.
Seven coefficients and one bias start at zero. Online logistic gradient updates
use learning rate 1 and L2 coefficient 0.001 on the seven coefficients. No
normalization is fitted on evaluation data, and no synapse in the connectome is
changed. Exact protocol settings and before/after weights accompany each export.

The **untrained control** retains its initial zero weights and uses a reproducible
random tie-break independent of the target. Both decoders see the same neural
features and share the tie-breaking draw on each trial. This comparator tests
the effect of decoder training. An ordinary rule reading the cue directly could
solve the artificial task perfectly; no shuffled-connectome or conventional
controller comparison is included, so success does not establish an advantage
for biological wiring.

**Separate moving and pressing.** In this experiment, the decoder selects a letter,
an added display controller guides the fly to that key, and an explicit press
commits it. Transit does not type; repeated letters are allowed. Every decision,
including errors, is retained. Motion is assisted, not learned locomotion. The
original free-exploration mode and historical recordings preserve their original
region-entry typing rules.

The graph shows accuracy in non-overlapping blocks of ten, and the table reports
all decisions in each phase. Evaluation shows a 95% Wilson interval for trial
accuracy within that run. These intervals do not quantify variability across
anatomical brains. Different seeds are technical replicates of one connectome.
Evaluation outcomes remain visible to the observer, but never update the decoder.

**Export run** downloads all completed trial records (including partial paused
runs), predictions, targets, neural noise seeds, raw counts/rates/features,
weights, configuration, and connectivity provenance/hashes. The browser checks
that evaluation weights remain unchanged before marking a run complete.

Full-connectome development checks used seeds 42, 43, and 44 with the same default
protocol. Each scored 40/40 on evaluation (per-run 95% Wilson interval 91.2–100%);
the corresponding untrained controls scored 26/40, 18/40, and 24/40. These are
developmental checks, not a preregistered study. Raw outputs and complete results
are in [the benchmark report](results/learning_benchmark/report.md). Reproduce them with:

```bash
node scripts/benchmark_learning.cjs --seeds 42,43,44 --out results/learning_benchmark
node --test tests/test_live_model.cjs tests/test_learning_model.cjs tests/test_learning_worker.cjs
```

Implementation: `site/learning-model.js` is the DOM-independent experiment;
`site/learning-worker.js` schedules bounded work and `site/connectome-loader.js`
verifies the complete wiring. `site/learning.js` renders the experiment and
assisted presses. Build `learn.html` and `index.html` with
`python scripts/build_site.py` from their `site/*head.html` and `site/*body.html`
templates. Tests cover cue/readout separation, fresh trial state, unchanged
connectivity, frozen evaluation, independent random streams, unfiltered errors,
explicit presses, and worker pause/restart/export/error behavior.

This first benchmark is motivated by [connectome reservoir computing](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12109256/),
which used different neuron dynamics and does not validate this implementation.
Biologically grounded dopamine-modulated plasticity, a broader symbol set,
unassisted navigation, and sequence recall remain future experiments.

## Notes and caveats

* The FlyWire volume is a brain without a ventral nerve cord: descending-neuron activity is
  read out directly as locomotion with hand-set gains. The gains, the base speed and the
  looming gain are the free parameters of Phase 2 and are all in `config.yaml`.
* Shiu et al. note that absolute firing rates of the model are not to be trusted; the
  validation is about which neurons respond and how the response scales.
* 616 neurons in `neurons.csv` have no connections at all and never do anything.
